Guestronomy
===========
The application may be found at: [Guestronomy](https://mighty-basin-50114.herokuapp.com/) 

User Story
----------
Guestronomy is an ecosystem for home cooking. The platform allows chefs to host private dinners and an opportunity for guests to experience novel private dining experiences. 
A user may be a chef or guest or both depending on what they opt to do once they are logged in. The accounts do not discriminate.
Guests may sign up / log in, view events and request to be invited to a chef's private event. 
A chef may sign up / log in, create events and select who they would like to attend an event. 


Design
----------
This was the second module of a GA WDI course and provided a rich testing ground as my first foray into ruby, rails and databases. The application took approximately 3 days to complete and whilst it enables basic functionality, it's form remains raw. (not refactored) 

I intend to build out this app in the future using the skills developed since this app was created (using a different stack!).
